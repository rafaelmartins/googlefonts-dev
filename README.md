# googlefonts-dev

A simple script to create CSS boilerplate and download Google Fonts for offline development.

Sample call:

    $ /googlefonts_dev.py "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poiret+One|PT+Serif|Open+Sans:400,300"

This will create a `fonts.css` file and a `fonts/` directory with the downloaded fonts.

> **PLEASE NOTE**: Google Fonts provides optimized CSS for the popular web browsers. This script will use the non-optimized CSS returned when the request does not contains any known user-agent. You should not use it the files generated by this script in production. Please rely on your template engine to just include these files when you are developing locally.
