# googlefonts-dev

A simple script to create CSS boilerplate and download Google Fonts for offline development.

Sample call:

    $ /googlefonts_dev.py "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poiret+One|PT+Serif|Open+Sans:400,300"

This will create a `fonts.css` file and a `fonts/` directory with the downloaded fonts.

> **WARNING**: Google Fonts provides optimized CSS for the popular web browsers. This script will use the non-optimized CSS returned when the request does not contains any known user-agent. You should not use the files generated by this script in production. Please use your template engine to include these files only when you are running your application in development mode.
